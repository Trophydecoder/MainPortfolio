        <p>
          Iâ€™m a passionate Full-Stack Developer who enjoys transforming ideas
          into real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in frontend and
          backend development, I specialize in building responsive,
          user-friendly web applications that are both visually appealing and
          functionally robust. On the frontend, I work with modern frameworks
          and tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular to create seamless
          user experiences. On the backend, I leverage Node.js, Express, and
          MySQL to design secure APIs, manage databases, and build scalable
          systems.
