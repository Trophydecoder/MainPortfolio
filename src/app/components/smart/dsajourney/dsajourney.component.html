              As a self-taught developer, I used to focus mainly on languages, frameworks, 
              and building projects. While that helped me grow fast, I realized that to 
              become a stronger problem solver, I needed to focus on 
              <span class="highlight">Data Structures & Algorithms</span>.  
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">
              Recently, I started my DSA journey - documenting and sharing my progress 
              on <span class="highlight">LinkedIn</span>. This new path is helping me 
              strengthen my logical thinking, improve how I break down problems, and 
              sharpen my coding skills for real-world challenges.
